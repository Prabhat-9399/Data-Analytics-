6.Description
  This project focuses on building a Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard using Power BI for a telecommunications company. 
  The goal of the project is to identify churn patterns and understand customer behavior through data-driven insights. 
  Customer data was cleaned, transformed, and modeled using Power Query and basic DAX measures. 
  The dashboard provides a clear overview of churn rate, total customers, and churned customers. 
  Interactive visualizations analyze churn based on contract type, payment method, internet service, tenure, and demographics. 
  Key insights highlight higher churn among month-to-month contracts, electronic payment users, and short-tenure customers. 
  This dashboard helps stakeholders identify at-risk customers and design effective retention strategies. 
  The project demonstrates practical skills in data analysis, visualization, and business intelligence using Power BI.
